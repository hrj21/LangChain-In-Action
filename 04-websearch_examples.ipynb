However, since wins and losses are a team achievement, only lesser known statistics are listed here. The longest losing streak of his career was eight games, which occurred during his third stint in the NBA, with the Washington Wizards (November 4 to 22, 2001). The longest losing streak of his Chicago Bulls career was six games, which occurred twice (March 9 to 17, 1987 and April 6 to 16, 1989).  This latter losing streak began with the last game of Jordan's triple-double streak. The longest losing streak of the Chicago Bulls dynasty era was three games, which occurred at the very beginning of the era (November 2 to 6, 1990). The longest winning streak of his career was 18 games, which occurred from December 29, 1995, to February 2, 1996.  At the time, it was tied for the third longest winning steak in NBA history, and is now tied for the 11th longest winning streak in NBA history.  It is the longest winning streak in Chicago Bulls franchise history. The Chicago Bulls also set the NBA playoff record for consecutive road victories at eight, across the 1991 and 1992 postseasons.  It was later broken by the Los Angeles Lakers during a stretch from 2001 to 2002.

However, since wins and losses are a team achievement, only lesser known statistics are listed here. The longest losing streak of his career was eight games, which occurred during his third stint in the NBA, with the Washington Wizards (November 4 to 22, 2001). The longest losing streak of his Chicago Bulls career was six games, which occurred twice (March 9 to 17, 1987 and April 6 to 16, 1989).  This latter losing streak began with the last game of Jordan's triple-double streak. The longest losing streak of the Chicago Bulls dynasty era was three games, which occurred at the very beginning of the era (November 2 to 6, 1990). The longest winning streak of his career was 18 games, which occurred from December 29, 1995, to February 2, 1996.  At the time, it was tied for the third longest winning steak in NBA history, and is now tied for the 11th longest winning streak in NBA history.  It is the longest winning streak in Chicago Bulls franchise history. The Chicago Bulls also set the NBA playoff record for consecutive road victories at eight, across the 1991 and 1992 postseasons.  It was later broken by the Los Angeles Lakers during a stretch from 2001 to 2002.

Spain is a lot more than just sun, sand and sea... Astorga - A Must-visit! Saturday, October 12, 2024 @ 12:26 PM Astorga is the place where two of Spain\\'s most important cultural routes converge: the Way of Saint James and the Silver Route. With over 2,000 years of history, this city in Castile-León is home to a surprising monumental site, where Renaissance cathedrals and Roman baths jostle with the modernism of Gaudí. To discover Astorga you have to head for the province of León, in northwestern Spain. It is located just 45 kilometres from the city of the same name, León, in a region known as La Maragatería. After being conquered by the Romans, the town became an important strategic centre, mainly on account of the area\\'s wealth in deposits of gold. The heritage of that period and the remains of the mines themselves are some of the attractions you will find in Astorga, but not the only ones. The first thing you will notice when you get to the town is the view of two of its most important monuments, Santa María Cathedral and the Episcopal Palace. The two buildings are set side by side and are surrounded by a Roman defensive wall which is in an excellent state of conservation. Take a close look, because the Cathedral is a beautiful synthesis of styles, with elements ranging from Florid Gothic to Baroque and Renaissance. This is because construction work began in the 15th century and was not completed until the 18th. Another unusual aspect is the difference in colour of the two towers that flank the main entrance - one of them was affected by an earthquake in 1775 and took longer to be finished. Inside, be sure to admire the stunning main altarpiece and choir stalls. Beside the Cathedral is the Episcopal Palace, designed by the famous modernist architect Antonio Gaudí. It is a neo-gothic building that looks like something out of a fairy tale. In the garden outside you will be welcomed by three angels in zinc, and inside you can visit the Los Caminos Museum, which has an interesting collection of items related with the Way of Saint James. Astorga is home to other interesting buildings, such as Casa Granell House and San Andrés Church. Next, head for Plaza Mayor Square where you will find the baroque Town Hall and a traditional street market held every Tuesday morning. A visit to the town\\'s Roman remains is also not to be missed. You will find remains of the forum, thermal baths, \"domus\" (houses), the imperial temple, the camp of the legion and the drainage network. In the ancient Ergastula (prison) you will now find the Roman Museum with statues, amphorae, jewellery and reliefs. To make sure you see everything, it is best first to visit the town\\'s Tourist Office. If you have more time, head out to one of the surrounding villages and discover the charm and character of the traditional architecture of the La Maragatería region. Castrillo de los Polvazares, for example, just 5 kilometres from Astorga, is home to a good representation, and we would also recommend you try the typical dish of the region: maragato casserole. You can also do the “Gold Route”, that will take you to different villages around the region in search of ancient Roman mines. Be sure to make a stop to discover Astorga. You will be pleasantly surprised. 5 Like Share it! Permalink Spam post or Abuse?

It features a blend of Gothic, Neo-Classical, Baroque, and Renaissance styles, with elements such as the high altar by Gaspar Becerra adding to its grandeur. The cathedral\\'s rectangular layout with apsidal chapels creates a bright and clear interior reminiscent of German Gothic architecture. Cathedral is just amazing both inside and outside. Highly recommend to visit.\\nThe construction of this gothic cathedral was begun in 1471 and lasted until the 18th century. To its original Gothic style appearance were added elements from later styles, such as the Neo-Classicist cloister, the Baroque towers, capitals and the façade, and the Renaissance portico. With a rectangular layout, with apsidal chapels, very clear and bright, it has an architectural closeness to German Gothic. Olga S — Google review Perhaps not as prestigious as other Cathedrals that line the way of St James or those such as Oviedo and Toledo, but it certainly still warrants a visit. The entrance fee is fairly modest and includes a small adjoining museum.\\nThe Cathedral is impressive its original structure being romanesque, before being altered into the gothic style in the 15th century, with latter neo classist and baroque additions. Also worth attention is the beautifully carved western door, with its depiction of the scene of La Piedad on the portico above it. Stuart M — Google review A fantastic piece of art well worth the visit. The museum has impressive pieces, virtual reality and the cathedral itself is excellent.\\nThey even have some pieces of the true cross! Francisco J — Google review Only bought something in the souvenir shop and went inside to the toilets but was able to go inside the garden and to light a candle in the cathedral. Leen — Google review Both the museum and the cathedral are stunning! Definitely a must! אביב ל — Google review An amazing place. Such an incredibly beautiful day. Missed the Gaudi museum just by, but will go back some day. Belle W — Google review The cathedral is a  magnificent temple in the ancient and noble city of Astorga (this is only the modern name, as this city was founded by the ancient Romans, who called it Augusta Asturica). The guided visit is highly recommended for its value for money. In fact it is a guided tour, but at the same time autonomous because one receives an audio guide, through which he is able to do the visit at his own pace and time. Furthermore, there is a room with a virtual reality device that allows to visit the cathedral as if one were flying inside it, and then also outside it, you could say an angel\\'s flight! The icing on the cake is that, for pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago, the visit has a reduced cost.

Jack Pearce for Lonely Planet On a cliffside in Fisterra , Spain, I sipped orujo de hierbas (herbal brandy) while victorious hikers rested on rocks overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. Yet unlike those tourists with battered clothes and stamped Pilgrim Passports, I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t arrived at Spainâ\\x80\\x99s Costa da Morte by foot. Rather, I was road-tripping across the Camino de Santiago , one of the world's most popular pilgrimage routes . While the Camino splinters into multiple paths with various starting points, the Camino Frances ranks as the most popular track . It intersects with the Spanish regions of Galicia and Castilla y LeÃ³n, which widely appeal to hikers in search of spiritual clarity, a sense of accomplishment, or, quite simply, a nice, long walk. Northwest Spain, however, is far more than its trails . The Way of St. James pairs the landscapes of Green Spain with Gothic cathedrals, family-run wineries and longstanding traditions that range from the crafty to the spooky. Here, youâ\\x80\\x99ll find eight reasons why Galicia and Castilla y LeÃ³n warrant a pilgrimage in their own right â\\x80\\x94 with or without your hiking boots. 1. Chase waterfalls en route to the end of the world While the Camino technically ends in Santiago de Compostela, many pilgrims extend their journeys further west to MuxÃ\\xada and Fisterra, fittingly nicknamed â\\x80\\x9cthe end of the worldâ\\x80\\x9d as one of mainland Spainâ\\x80\\x99s westernmost points. Because I was traveling by car, I visited both locations in one scenic day, breaking up the drive with a stop at the Ã\\x89zaro waterfall. The peaceful landscape counts as Europeâ\\x80\\x99s only river to meet the ocean via waterfall. Advertisement Also leading to the worldâ\\x80\\x99s end is the quaint fishing town of Muros, where curious dolphins frequently surface in the harbor. Planning tip: Access to the waterfall is both free and straightforward; thereâ\\x80\\x99s a parking lot with a boardwalk that leads to Ã\\x89zaro, as well as bathrooms, food stands and kiosks to stamp your pilgrim passport. A little ways away, the Mirador de Ã\\x89zaro overlooks the coastline, with sweeping vistas that demonstrate where, exactly, the river meets the sea. Take a boat trip through the wineries of the Ribeira Sacra. Martin Boujon Zappino/Shutterstock 2. Take a boat trip to the wine region of Ribeira Sacra For an experience thatâ\\x80\\x99s truly off the beaten path, head to the Ribeira Sacra: a dramatic wine landscape known for the production of MencÃ\\xada. Divided by a series of rivers, the Ribeira Sacraâ\\x80\\x99s steep mountains contain sloping vineyards that are best explored by boat. I took a boat tour that drifted along the MiÃ±o River before stopping at a riverfront wine cellar. There, I savored a lunch of chestnut jamÃ³n, Galician-style empanadas, and, of course, plenty of red wine. Some boat tours serve wine onboard, while others â\\x80\\x93 particularly those near the Sil Canyon â\\x80\\x93 beckon to birdwatchers with peregrine falcons and the occasional golden eagle. Planning tip: Pricing and hours for boat experiences depend on your length of visit and group size; my group tour cost roughly â\\x82¬42 Euros (US$45) and spanned two and a half hours â\\x80\\x94 the perfect amount of time for a leisurely lunch and sightseeing. Even if youâ\\x80\\x99re visiting the Ribeira Sacra by car, you should pre-book your tasting. Some wineries accommodate walk-ins, but depending on the wineryâ\\x80\\x99s size, youâ\\x80\\x99re never guaranteed a seat without a reservation. 3. Tour an 18th-century palace-turned-winery If you prefer your wineries on land, youâ\\x80\\x99ll find one of the most memorable tasting experiences in Castilla y LeÃ³nâ\\x80\\x99s El Bierzo wine region. Palacio de Canedo , an 18th-century palace, functions as a hotel, restaurant and winery,\\xa0specializing in red MencÃ\\xada and white Godello wines,\\xa0with more than 30 hectares (74 acres) of vineyards. Before you pick up your fork, hop aboard the propertyâ\\x80\\x99s open-air trolley and embark on something of a wine safari. As you weave between the vines, youâ\\x80\\x99ll feel the terrain firsthand â\\x80\\x93 and whet your appetite for a wine-paired tasting menu. Donâ\\x80\\x99t leave El Bierzo without trying botillo, a regional meat specialty. Advertisement Planning tip: A tour on Palacio de Canedoâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9c CarroviÃ±as â\\x80\\x9d costs between â\\x82¬48 and â\\x82¬60 (US$52-65) for two people and, like most attractions along the Camino, is best reserved prior to your arrival. If youâ\\x80\\x99re planning to eat, the restaurant tends to fill up, so make your reservation in advance. Relax and people watch outside the stunning Burgos Cathedral. Shutterstock 4. Go city-hopping between Burgos and LeÃ³n Itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to mistake the Camino de Santiago for a quiet respite thatâ\\x80\\x99s all about nature. The trail certainly overlaps with some of Spainâ\\x80\\x99s most pristine scenery, but it also passes through lively cities brimming with Gothic architecture and tapas bars\", 'result_url': 'https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/camino-de-santiago-activities-beyond-the-trails', 'search_query': 'things to do in Astorga Spain travel guide'}, {'result_text': \"▷ Discovering Astorga: A Gem of Spanish Tourism ✅ 【 2025 】 Saltar al contenido Home Travel Health Passport Restrictions Insurance About Eli Contact Menú de navegación Menú de navegación Home Travel Health Passport Restrictions Insurance About Eli Contact Discovering Astorga: A Gem of Spanish Tourism por Elisabeth Gonzalez Smith agosto 29, 2024 Nestled in the heart of Spain, Astorga is a captivating blend of history, culture, and stunning architecture that beckons travelers from around the globe.

All Spain blogs Start your own blog Blog RSS Max Abroad : The Best of Spain Quite simply writing about the best things Spain has to offer and anything that might crop up along the way. Spain is a lot more than just sun, sand and sea... Astorga - A Must-visit! Saturday, October 12, 2024 @ 12:26 PM Astorga is the place where two of Spain\\'s most important cultural routes converge: the Way of Saint James and the Silver Route. With over 2,000 years of history, this city in Castile-León is home to a surprising monumental site, where Renaissance cathedrals and Roman baths jostle with the modernism of Gaudí. To discover Astorga you have to head for the province of León, in northwestern Spain. It is located just 45 kilometres from the city of the same name, León, in a region known as La Maragatería. After being conquered by the Romans, the town became an important strategic centre, mainly on account of the area\\'s wealth in deposits of gold. The heritage of that period and the remains of the mines themselves are some of the attractions you will find in Astorga, but not the only ones. The first thing you will notice when you get to the town is the view of two of its most important monuments, Santa María Cathedral and the Episcopal Palace. The two buildings are set side by side and are surrounded by a Roman defensive wall which is in an excellent state of conservation. Take a close look, because the Cathedral is a beautiful synthesis of styles, with elements ranging from Florid Gothic to Baroque and Renaissance. This is because construction work began in the 15th century and was not completed until the 18th. Another unusual aspect is the difference in colour of the two towers that flank the main entrance - one of them was affected by an earthquake in 1775 and took longer to be finished. Inside, be sure to admire the stunning main altarpiece and choir stalls. Beside the Cathedral is the Episcopal Palace, designed by the famous modernist architect Antonio Gaudí. It is a neo-gothic building that looks like something out of a fairy tale. In the garden outside you will be welcomed by three angels in zinc, and inside you can visit the Los Caminos Museum, which has an interesting collection of items related with the Way of Saint James. Astorga is home to other interesting buildings, such as Casa Granell House and San Andrés Church. Next, head for Plaza Mayor Square where you will find the baroque Town Hall and a traditional street market held every Tuesday morning. A visit to the town\\'s Roman remains is also not to be missed. You will find remains of the forum, thermal baths, \"domus\" (houses), the imperial temple, the camp of the legion and the drainage network. In the ancient Ergastula (prison) you will now find the Roman Museum with statues, amphorae, jewellery and reliefs. To make sure you see everything, it is best first to visit the town\\'s Tourist Office. If you have more time, head out to one of the surrounding villages and discover the charm and character of the traditional architecture of the La Maragatería region. Castrillo de los Polvazares, for example, just 5 kilometres from Astorga, is home to a good representation, and we would also recommend you try the typical dish of the region: maragato casserole. You can also do the “Gold Route”, that will take you to different villages around the region in search of ancient Roman mines. Be sure to make a stop to discover Astorga. You will be pleasantly surprised. 5 Like Share it! Permalink Spam post or Abuse?

Spain is a lot more than just sun, sand and sea... Astorga - A Must-visit! Saturday, October 12, 2024 @ 12:26 PM Astorga is the place where two of Spain\\'s most important cultural routes converge: the Way of Saint James and the Silver Route. With over 2,000 years of history, this city in Castile-León is home to a surprising monumental site, where Renaissance cathedrals and Roman baths jostle with the modernism of Gaudí. To discover Astorga you have to head for the province of León, in northwestern Spain. It is located just 45 kilometres from the city of the same name, León, in a region known as La Maragatería. After being conquered by the Romans, the town became an important strategic centre, mainly on account of the area\\'s wealth in deposits of gold. The heritage of that period and the remains of the mines themselves are some of the attractions you will find in Astorga, but not the only ones. The first thing you will notice when you get to the town is the view of two of its most important monuments, Santa María Cathedral and the Episcopal Palace. The two buildings are set side by side and are surrounded by a Roman defensive wall which is in an excellent state of conservation. Take a close look, because the Cathedral is a beautiful synthesis of styles, with elements ranging from Florid Gothic to Baroque and Renaissance. This is because construction work began in the 15th century and was not completed until the 18th. Another unusual aspect is the difference in colour of the two towers that flank the main entrance - one of them was affected by an earthquake in 1775 and took longer to be finished. Inside, be sure to admire the stunning main altarpiece and choir stalls. Beside the Cathedral is the Episcopal Palace, designed by the famous modernist architect Antonio Gaudí. It is a neo-gothic building that looks like something out of a fairy tale. In the garden outside you will be welcomed by three angels in zinc, and inside you can visit the Los Caminos Museum, which has an interesting collection of items related with the Way of Saint James. Astorga is home to other interesting buildings, such as Casa Granell House and San Andrés Church. Next, head for Plaza Mayor Square where you will find the baroque Town Hall and a traditional street market held every Tuesday morning. A visit to the town\\'s Roman remains is also not to be missed. You will find remains of the forum, thermal baths, \"domus\" (houses), the imperial temple, the camp of the legion and the drainage network. In the ancient Ergastula (prison) you will now find the Roman Museum with statues, amphorae, jewellery and reliefs. To make sure you see everything, it is best first to visit the town\\'s Tourist Office. If you have more time, head out to one of the surrounding villages and discover the charm and character of the traditional architecture of the La Maragatería region. Castrillo de los Polvazares, for example, just 5 kilometres from Astorga, is home to a good representation, and we would also recommend you try the typical dish of the region: maragato casserole. You can also do the “Gold Route”, that will take you to different villages around the region in search of ancient Roman mines. Be sure to make a stop to discover Astorga. You will be pleasantly surprised. 5 Like Share it! Permalink Spam post or Abuse?

It features a blend of Gothic, Neo-Classical, Baroque, and Renaissance styles, with elements such as the high altar by Gaspar Becerra adding to its grandeur. The cathedral\\'s rectangular layout with apsidal chapels creates a bright and clear interior reminiscent of German Gothic architecture. Cathedral is just amazing both inside and outside. Highly recommend to visit.\\nThe construction of this gothic cathedral was begun in 1471 and lasted until the 18th century. To its original Gothic style appearance were added elements from later styles, such as the Neo-Classicist cloister, the Baroque towers, capitals and the façade, and the Renaissance portico. With a rectangular layout, with apsidal chapels, very clear and bright, it has an architectural closeness to German Gothic. Olga S — Google review Perhaps not as prestigious as other Cathedrals that line the way of St James or those such as Oviedo and Toledo, but it certainly still warrants a visit. The entrance fee is fairly modest and includes a small adjoining museum.\\nThe Cathedral is impressive its original structure being romanesque, before being altered into the gothic style in the 15th century, with latter neo classist and baroque additions. Also worth attention is the beautifully carved western door, with its depiction of the scene of La Piedad on the portico above it. Stuart M — Google review A fantastic piece of art well worth the visit. The museum has impressive pieces, virtual reality and the cathedral itself is excellent.\\nThey even have some pieces of the true cross! Francisco J — Google review Only bought something in the souvenir shop and went inside to the toilets but was able to go inside the garden and to light a candle in the cathedral. Leen — Google review Both the museum and the cathedral are stunning! Definitely a must! אביב ל — Google review An amazing place. Such an incredibly beautiful day. Missed the Gaudi museum just by, but will go back some day. Belle W — Google review The cathedral is a  magnificent temple in the ancient and noble city of Astorga (this is only the modern name, as this city was founded by the ancient Romans, who called it Augusta Asturica). The guided visit is highly recommended for its value for money. In fact it is a guided tour, but at the same time autonomous because one receives an audio guide, through which he is able to do the visit at his own pace and time. Furthermore, there is a room with a virtual reality device that allows to visit the cathedral as if one were flying inside it, and then also outside it, you could say an angel\\'s flight! The icing on the cake is that, for pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago, the visit has a reduced cost.

Jack Pearce for Lonely Planet On a cliffside in Fisterra , Spain, I sipped orujo de hierbas (herbal brandy) while victorious hikers rested on rocks overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. Yet unlike those tourists with battered clothes and stamped Pilgrim Passports, I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t arrived at Spainâ\\x80\\x99s Costa da Morte by foot. Rather, I was road-tripping across the Camino de Santiago , one of the world's most popular pilgrimage routes . While the Camino splinters into multiple paths with various starting points, the Camino Frances ranks as the most popular track . It intersects with the Spanish regions of Galicia and Castilla y LeÃ³n, which widely appeal to hikers in search of spiritual clarity, a sense of accomplishment, or, quite simply, a nice, long walk. Northwest Spain, however, is far more than its trails . The Way of St. James pairs the landscapes of Green Spain with Gothic cathedrals, family-run wineries and longstanding traditions that range from the crafty to the spooky. Here, youâ\\x80\\x99ll find eight reasons why Galicia and Castilla y LeÃ³n warrant a pilgrimage in their own right â\\x80\\x94 with or without your hiking boots. 1. Chase waterfalls en route to the end of the world While the Camino technically ends in Santiago de Compostela, many pilgrims extend their journeys further west to MuxÃ\\xada and Fisterra, fittingly nicknamed â\\x80\\x9cthe end of the worldâ\\x80\\x9d as one of mainland Spainâ\\x80\\x99s westernmost points. Because I was traveling by car, I visited both locations in one scenic day, breaking up the drive with a stop at the Ã\\x89zaro waterfall. The peaceful landscape counts as Europeâ\\x80\\x99s only river to meet the ocean via waterfall. Advertisement Also leading to the worldâ\\x80\\x99s end is the quaint fishing town of Muros, where curious dolphins frequently surface in the harbor. Planning tip: Access to the waterfall is both free and straightforward; thereâ\\x80\\x99s a parking lot with a boardwalk that leads to Ã\\x89zaro, as well as bathrooms, food stands and kiosks to stamp your pilgrim passport. A little ways away, the Mirador de Ã\\x89zaro overlooks the coastline, with sweeping vistas that demonstrate where, exactly, the river meets the sea. Take a boat trip through the wineries of the Ribeira Sacra. Martin Boujon Zappino/Shutterstock 2. Take a boat trip to the wine region of Ribeira Sacra For an experience thatâ\\x80\\x99s truly off the beaten path, head to the Ribeira Sacra: a dramatic wine landscape known for the production of MencÃ\\xada. Divided by a series of rivers, the Ribeira Sacraâ\\x80\\x99s steep mountains contain sloping vineyards that are best explored by boat. I took a boat tour that drifted along the MiÃ±o River before stopping at a riverfront wine cellar. There, I savored a lunch of chestnut jamÃ³n, Galician-style empanadas, and, of course, plenty of red wine.

As you weave between the vines, youâ\\x80\\x99ll feel the terrain firsthand â\\x80\\x93 and whet your appetite for a wine-paired tasting menu. Donâ\\x80\\x99t leave El Bierzo without trying botillo, a regional meat specialty.

All Spain blogs Start your own blog Blog RSS Max Abroad : The Best of Spain Quite simply writing about the best things Spain has to offer and anything that might crop up along the way. Spain is a lot more than just sun, sand and sea... Astorga - A Must-visit! Saturday, October 12, 2024 @ 12:26 PM Astorga is the place where two of Spain\\'s most important cultural routes converge: the Way of Saint James and the Silver Route. With over 2,000 years of history, this city in Castile-León is home to a surprising monumental site, where Renaissance cathedrals and Roman baths jostle with the modernism of Gaudí. To discover Astorga you have to head for the province of León, in northwestern Spain. It is located just 45 kilometres from the city of the same name, León, in a region known as La Maragatería. After being conquered by the Romans, the town became an important strategic centre, mainly on account of the area\\'s wealth in deposits of gold. The heritage of that period and the remains of the mines themselves are some of the attractions you will find in Astorga, but not the only ones. The first thing you will notice when you get to the town is the view of two of its most important monuments, Santa María Cathedral and the Episcopal Palace. The two buildings are set side by side and are surrounded by a Roman defensive wall which is in an excellent state of conservation. Take a close look, because the Cathedral is a beautiful synthesis of styles, with elements ranging from Florid Gothic to Baroque and Renaissance. This is because construction work began in the 15th century and was not completed until the 18th. Another unusual aspect is the difference in colour of the two towers that flank the main entrance - one of them was affected by an earthquake in 1775 and took longer to be finished. Inside, be sure to admire the stunning main altarpiece and choir stalls. Beside the Cathedral is the Episcopal Palace, designed by the famous modernist architect Antonio Gaudí. It is a neo-gothic building that looks like something out of a fairy tale. In the garden outside you will be welcomed by three angels in zinc, and inside you can visit the Los Caminos Museum, which has an interesting collection of items related with the Way of Saint James. Astorga is home to other interesting buildings, such as Casa Granell House and San Andrés Church. Next, head for Plaza Mayor Square where you will find the baroque Town Hall and a traditional street market held every Tuesday morning. A visit to the town\\'s Roman remains is also not to be missed. You will find remains of the forum, thermal baths, \"domus\" (houses), the imperial temple, the camp of the legion and the drainage network. In the ancient Ergastula (prison) you will now find the Roman Museum with statues, amphorae, jewellery and reliefs. To make sure you see everything, it is best first to visit the town\\'s Tourist Office. If you have more time, head out to one of the surrounding villages and discover the charm and character of the traditional architecture of the La Maragatería region. Castrillo de los Polvazares, for example, just 5 kilometres from Astorga, is home to a good representation, and we would also recommend you try the typical dish of the region: maragato casserole. You can also do the “Gold Route”, that will take you to different villages around the region in search of ancient Roman mines. Be sure to make a stop to discover Astorga. You will be pleasantly surprised. 5 Like Share it! Permalink Spam post or Abuse?
