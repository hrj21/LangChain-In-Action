The city flourished for approximately two centuries as an autonomous Greek polis, developing a democratic system and enjoying intense cultural and commercial exchange with the Greek world and non-Greek populations, including the Etruscans. It was endowed with a defensive wall featuring four gates and saw the construction of three notable Doric temples in the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, often referred to as dedicated to Hera and Athena, although there has been some debate about the specific deities honored. A Greek agora was established north of the sanctuary of Hera, which included civic structures such as a bouleuterion.\\n\\nIn 400 BCE, control shifted to the Lucanians, an indigenous Italic people, who renamed the city Paestum. However, evidence indicates that during this period, the city continued to be referred to as Poseidonia by many scholars. Though traditional historical interpretations suggest that the transition from Poseidonia to Paestum involved a cultural transformation due to violent conquest, recent research suggests that this transition may have occurred gradually and peacefully. The archaeological record reveals that Poseidonia continued to prosper during the Lucanian period, with existing temples being maintained and worship practices persisting, including the construction of two stoai and an Asklepieion at the agora. Despite earlier beliefs that the Lucanians enslaved the Greeks, evidence shows that Greek practices, including language and civic structures, persisted during and after the shift in control. The name change may have been a later development, potentially related to the Roman conquest.\\n\\nThe city remained under Lucanian rule until 273 BCE, when it became a Roman colony. The process of Roman colonization followed a ritualistic tradition, involving specific founding ceremonies that established a connection to Rome's mythological origins. The city continued to thrive during the early Roman Empire but eventually succumbed to environmental changes, such as the silting up of the Silarus River leading to the creation of a malarial swamp, and was ultimately abandoned after being sacked by Muslim raiders in 871 CE.\\n\\nAfter the founding of the Roman colony, Paestum underwent significant changes, adapting its political and civic structures to align with Roman models while retaining elements of its Greek and Lucanian heritage. The Greek/Lucanian agora ceased operation as a new Roman forum was established, leading to the demolition of traditional buildings. However, sanctuaries continued to be respected and remained active sites of worship. During the Second Punic War, despite the dangers posed by Hannibal, Paestum demonstrated loyalty to Rome, which in turn granted the city a degree of autonomy, including the privilege of minting its own coins.\\n\\nToday, the well-preserved ruins of Paestum attract visitors to its archaeological site, which covers around 25 hectares of the original 120-hectare expanse. The three Doric temples constructed between 550 and 450 BCE are a significant draw, showcasing traditional Greek architectural features like massive colonnades with pronounced entasis. Notably, the Doric Order of Paestum is characterized by the most exaggerated entasis of any Antique example, with very wide squat capitals that emphasize a primitive effect.

The city thrived as a Greek settlement for about two centuries, witnessing the development of democracy. In 400 BCE, the Lucanians seized the city. Romans took over in 273 BCE, renaming it Paestum and establishing a Latin colony. Later, its decline ensued from shifts in trade routes and the onset of flooding and marsh formation.

The city enjoyed the status of an autonomous Greek polis and was endowed with a defensive wall with four gates, probably built in phases. Inside the city walls three Doric-style temples were erected in the sixth and fifth centuries. There has been some disagreement on which gods the temples were dedicated too, however, even though within the scope of this study they are referred to as Hera I, Hera II and the Temple of Athena, they might as well have been dedicated to more than one god. A Greek agora was also laid out north of the sanctuary of Hera (Fig. 6). It was adorned with a variety of Greek features; among them a bouleuterion or possible ekklesiasterion.55 An intriguing structure identified as a heroon, a place that has been interpreted as being dedicated to founder of the city, was built on the western edge of the agora around 510-500 BC.56 Outside the walls of the city a possible harbour, its existence and position is however debated, several nekropoleis and extramural cult sites were located; of which one will be the focus of this study: The Sanctuary of Santa Venera south of the city wall. Poseidonia came to enjoy intense cultural and commercial exchange with the rest of the Greek world as well as non-Greek populations like the Etruscans to the north and other Italic tribes from the hinterland. The Etruscan influence combined with the Greek and local Poseidonian style can for example be seen in the very famous fifth century tomb known as Tomba del Tuffatore, the Tomb of the Diver.57 Altogether Poseidonia prospered  and continued doing so. When its mother colony, Sybaris, fell in 510 BC Poseidonia along with other colonies filled the gap as a commercial and cultural centre.58 However, as the fifth century closed, changes loomed on the horizon and the Greek settlement at Poseidonia was to be forever marked by what was to come.   2.1.2.

Samnite people were expanding in numbers and in need of new homes, and therefore looked to the prosperous Greek and Etruscan coastal cities. At the end of the fifth century cities like Cumae and Capua had been captured by the Samnites and around 400 BC also Poseidonia came to be under control of the Lucanians.60 This is the traditional interpretation among scholars. However, in the final discussion of this study I hope to nuance this interpretation a bit.  Consequently, there has been a strong belief among many scholars that a “profound cultural change took place in the second half of the fifth century” at Poseidonia as a result of this Lucanian invasion.61 However, recent research has showed us otherwise. It is clear that Poseidonia at some point became a Lucanian city and that this happened gradually and peacefully. Much of the earlier historical interpretation of the Lucanian overtaking of Poseidonia derives from a statement made by Aristoxenos of Tarentum, a pupil of Aristoteles writing in the fourth century BC. He claims that the Greeks were essentially enslaved by the “Tyrrhenians”. This have led scholars to blame the Lucanians for this supposed regression in culture, politics and economy. The “Tyrrhenians” in this case have been interpreted as the Lucanians but it might as well refer to the Romans, Campanians, another Samnite people or the Etruscans; the latter have in fact in ancient literature been generally referred to as “Tyrrhenians”.62 The pessimistic literary evidence concerning the new trends in Poseidonia does, however, not have much support in the archaeological material. The supposed subjugation of the Greeks and the violent conquest of the city may in fact rather be a reflection of Greek attitudes in Tarentum or maybe even part of a larger process going on in Southern Italy at the time: Lucanization.63 But the evidence from Poseidonia suggests that the Greek practises continued; the bouleuterion and the heroon remained in use and so did the Greek sanctuaries and the Greek language.64 Some scholars claim that the change of the Greek name Poseidonia to Paistos or Paistom (later Paestum) can be seen as evidence of a conflict between Greeks and Lucanians, if this renaming happened under the Lucanian rule. The exact time of the change is however unsure, it might as well be a result of the later Roman conquest.65 Pedley does, on the contrary, not agree with the renaming \\n                                                59 Fracchia & Gualtieri 1989, 217. 60 Pedley 1990, 97. 61 Pedley 1990, 97; Horsnaes 2002, 11. 62 Isayev 2007, 17-18. 63 Isayev 2007, 18-19; Zuchtriegel 2016, 14.  64 Pedley 1990, 97. 65 Mello 1985, 15.'}, {'current_refined_summary': '**Final Summary:**\\n\\nPaestum, an ancient Greek city located on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea in Magna Graecia, was established around 600 BCE by settlers from Sybaris, originally named Poseidonia.

During the fourth century BC and up to the establishing of the Latin colony in 273 BC Poseidonia prospered as revealed in the archaeological record. Although there were no major large-scale building programmes to match the constructions of the Greek temples and sanctuaries those places continued to be looked after and the gods were worshiped by the new inhabitants.67 However, two stoai were built at the Greek agora as well as an Asklepieion (Table). The changes that came along with the Lucanians are to be seen in the agriculturalization and the density of settlement of the territory of Poseidonia as well as new burial practices in terms of extraordinary decorations.68   2.1.3. The Latin colony In 273 BC the expanding city of Rome had reached past the river Sele and stood at the gates of the Greek/Lucanian city of Poseidonia. Rome had been expanding for years, and the Republic was founding colonies, ex novo or, in the case of Poseidonia-Paestum, taking over already established settlements, all over the Italian peninsula. The Roman colonies, perhaps especially the ones that were founded during the late Republic, were behaving in a strikingly uniform way. The Roman, or the Latin, colony, is well known for its formulaic way of structure and features; in other words, we know the nature of a Roman colony without having to see one. The foundation ritual has been described in ancient literary sources and is said to originate from the time of Rome’s mythological foundation when Romulus, 753 BC, with permission of the gods laid out the sacred boundary, pomerium, around the city.69 The founding ritual of the colonies is describes by Bispham in the article ‘Coloniam deducere: how Roman was the Roman colonisation during the middle Republic?’:   Firstly, the deductio, or marching out, of the colonists from Rome to the site of the colony; the deductor (founder), in ritual dress (the cinctus Gabinus), ploughs the sulcus primigenius (the original furrow), tracing the line of the future walls and instantiating a ritual barrier, the pomoerium.70    In other words, it is clear that there was a model for Roman colonization and that the newly founded colonies were using the same set of rules and rituals to express their relationship, as                                                 66 Pedley 1990, 97.  67 Pedley 1990, 112. 68 Pedley 1990, 97. 69 Plut.

As the following analysis of Poseidonia-Paestum will show, Rome was the model for the colony’s political system. The rôle of the city was, however, adapted to fit its purposes as a colony as well as a product of new and previous influence and it was thus not a direct replica.72       After the founding of the Latin colony the city was altered radically (Table). The Greek/Lucanian agora ceased to be in use and instead a Roman forum was laid out in the southern part of the old agora. Traditional Roman buildings, especially those relating to political and juridical aspects, were constructed at the new forum and simultaneously the buildings with similar functions at the agora were demolished. The sanctuaries, however, remained in use, both the intramural and the extramural. They were respected by the new settlers and continued to be objects of worship.73 A striking continuity of divine worshipping is analysed in detail in the further analysis of the Sanctuary of Santa Venera.      The bonds with the mother colony, the city of Rome, were strong; both in a juridical and political sense as well as affectional. Paestum supported Rome in times of need and aligned itself with its mother colony politically and diplomatically. When the Carthaginian general Hannibal was roaming around southern Italy during the second Punic War, 218-201 BC, and literally breathing down the necks of the Paestans, the city still remained loyal to Rome. However, the many wars and the feeling of unsafety these times must have given rise to might have been a hard blow on the Paestan society. That said, it is a well-known fact that nothing binds a society together like a common enemy, and Paestum was thus rewarded for its loyalty. A certain degree of autonomy was given to the city and also the privilege of striking its own coins.74 Thus, Rome continued to be a strong influencer on the Paestan society although it is evident, which is shown in the further analysis of some aspects of the nature of Roman influence, that the city never forgot its Greek and Lucanian roots. In 133 the via Popilia, running to the east of Paestum, was constructed and as a result of this the city was unfortunately cut off from principal routes connecting the city to the rest of the peninsula.75                                                            71 Bispham 2006, 73-74. 72 Sewell 2010, 86. 73 Pedley 1990, 113. 74 Pedley 1990, 113. 75 Pedley 1990, 113-114.'}, {'current_refined_summary': \"**Final Summary:**\\n\\nPaestum, an ancient Greek city located on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea in Magna Graecia, was established around 600 BCE by settlers from Sybaris, originally named Poseidonia.

The city walls and amphitheatre are largely intact, and the bottom of the walls of many other structures remain, as well as paved roads. The site is open to the public, and there is a modern national museum within it, which also contains the finds from the associated Greek site of Foce del Sele.\\nPaestum was established around 600 BCE by settlers from Sybaris, a Greek colony in southern Italy, under the name of Poseidonia (Ancient Greek: Ποσειδωνία). The city thrived as a Greek settlement for about two centuries, witnessing the development of democracy. In 400 BCE, the Lucanians seized the city. Romans took over in 273 BCE, renaming it Paestum and establishing a Latin colony. Later, its decline ensued from shifts in trade routes and the onset of flooding and marsh formation. As Pesto or Paestum, the town became a bishopric (now only titular), but it was abandoned in the Early Middle Ages, and left undisturbed and largely forgotten until the eighteenth century.\\nToday the remains of the city are found in the modern frazione of Paestum, which is part of the comune of Capaccio Paestum in the Province of Salerno in the region of Campania, Italy.

All are typical of the period, with massive colonnades having a very pronounced entasis (widening as they go down), and very wide capitals resembling upturned mushrooms. Above the columns, only the second Temple of Hera retains most of its entablature, the other two having only the architrave in place.\\nThese were dedicated to Hera and Athena (Juno and Minerva to the Romans), although previously they often have been identified otherwise, following eighteenth-century arguments. The two temples of Hera are right next to each other, while the Temple of Athena is on the other side of the town center. There were other temples, both Greek and Roman, which are far less well preserved. \\nPaestum is far from any sources of good marble.

Only the 25 hectares that contain the three main temples and the other main buildings have been excavated.

The city enjoyed the status of an autonomous Greek polis and was endowed with a defensive wall with four gates, probably built in phases. Inside the city walls three Doric-style temples were erected in the sixth and fifth centuries. There has been some disagreement on which gods the temples were dedicated too, however, even though within the scope of this study they are referred to as Hera I, Hera II and the Temple of Athena, they might as well have been dedicated to more than one god. A Greek agora was also laid out north of the sanctuary of Hera (Fig. 6). It was adorned with a variety of Greek features; among them a bouleuterion or possible ekklesiasterion.55 An intriguing structure identified as a heroon, a place that has been interpreted as being dedicated to founder of the city, was built on the western edge of the agora around 510-500 BC.56 Outside the walls of the city a possible harbour, its existence and position is however debated, several nekropoleis and extramural cult sites were located; of which one will be the focus of this study: The Sanctuary of Santa Venera south of the city wall. Poseidonia came to enjoy intense cultural and commercial exchange with the rest of the Greek world as well as non-Greek populations like the Etruscans to the north and other Italic tribes from the hinterland. The Etruscan influence combined with the Greek and local Poseidonian style can for example be seen in the very famous fifth century tomb known as Tomba del Tuffatore, the Tomb of the Diver.57 Altogether Poseidonia prospered  and continued doing so. When its mother colony, Sybaris, fell in 510 BC Poseidonia along with other colonies filled the gap as a commercial and cultural centre.58 However, as the fifth century closed, changes loomed on the horizon and the Greek settlement at Poseidonia was to be forever marked by what was to come.   2.1.2.

At the end of the fifth century cities like Cumae and Capua had been captured by the Samnites and around 400 BC also Poseidonia came to be under control of the Lucanians.60 This is the traditional interpretation among scholars. However, in the final discussion of this study I hope to nuance this interpretation a bit.  Consequently, there has been a strong belief among many scholars that a “profound cultural change took place in the second half of the fifth century” at Poseidonia as a result of this Lucanian invasion.61 However, recent research has showed us otherwise. It is clear that Poseidonia at some point became a Lucanian city and that this happened gradually and peacefully. Much of the earlier historical interpretation of the Lucanian overtaking of Poseidonia derives from a statement made by Aristoxenos of Tarentum, a pupil of Aristoteles writing in the fourth century BC. He claims that the Greeks were essentially enslaved by the “Tyrrhenians”. This have led scholars to blame the Lucanians for this supposed regression in culture, politics and economy. The “Tyrrhenians” in this case have been interpreted as the Lucanians but it might as well refer to the Romans, Campanians, another Samnite people or the Etruscans; the latter have in fact in ancient literature been generally referred to as “Tyrrhenians”.62 The pessimistic literary evidence concerning the new trends in Poseidonia does, however, not have much support in the archaeological material. The supposed subjugation of the Greeks and the violent conquest of the city may in fact rather be a reflection of Greek attitudes in Tarentum or maybe even part of a larger process going on in Southern Italy at the time: Lucanization.63 But the evidence from Poseidonia suggests that the Greek practises continued; the bouleuterion and the heroon remained in use and so did the Greek sanctuaries and the Greek language.64 Some scholars claim that the change of the Greek name Poseidonia to Paistos or Paistom (later Paestum) can be seen as evidence of a conflict between Greeks and Lucanians, if this renaming happened under the Lucanian rule. The exact time of the change is however unsure, it might as well be a result of the later Roman conquest.65 Pedley does, on the contrary, not agree with the renaming \\n                                                59 Fracchia & Gualtieri 1989, 217. 60 Pedley 1990, 97. 61 Pedley 1990, 97; Horsnaes 2002, 11. 62 Isayev 2007, 17-18. 63 Isayev 2007, 18-19; Zuchtriegel 2016, 14.  64 Pedley 1990, 97. 65 Mello 1985, 15.'}, {'current_refined_summary': '**Final Summary:**\\n\\nPaestum, an ancient Greek city located on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea in Magna Graecia, was established around 600 BCE by settlers from Sybaris, originally named Poseidonia.

During the fourth century BC and up to the establishing of the Latin colony in 273 BC Poseidonia prospered as revealed in the archaeological record. Although there were no major large-scale building programmes to match the constructions of the Greek temples and sanctuaries those places continued to be looked after and the gods were worshiped by the new inhabitants.67 However, two stoai were built at the Greek agora as well as an Asklepieion (Table). The changes that came along with the Lucanians are to be seen in the agriculturalization and the density of settlement of the territory of Poseidonia as well as new burial practices in terms of extraordinary decorations.68   2.1.3. The Latin colony In 273 BC the expanding city of Rome had reached past the river Sele and stood at the gates of the Greek/Lucanian city of Poseidonia. Rome had been expanding for years, and the Republic was founding colonies, ex novo or, in the case of Poseidonia-Paestum, taking over already established settlements, all over the Italian peninsula. The Roman colonies, perhaps especially the ones that were founded during the late Republic, were behaving in a strikingly uniform way. The Roman, or the Latin, colony, is well known for its formulaic way of structure and features; in other words, we know the nature of a Roman colony without having to see one. The foundation ritual has been described in ancient literary sources and is said to originate from the time of Rome’s mythological foundation when Romulus, 753 BC, with permission of the gods laid out the sacred boundary, pomerium, around the city.69 The founding ritual of the colonies is describes by Bispham in the article ‘Coloniam deducere: how Roman was the Roman colonisation during the middle Republic?’:   Firstly, the deductio, or marching out, of the colonists from Rome to the site of the colony; the deductor (founder), in ritual dress (the cinctus Gabinus), ploughs the sulcus primigenius (the original furrow), tracing the line of the future walls and instantiating a ritual barrier, the pomoerium.70    In other words, it is clear that there was a model for Roman colonization and that the newly founded colonies were using the same set of rules and rituals to express their relationship, as                                                 66 Pedley 1990, 97.  67 Pedley 1990, 112. 68 Pedley 1990, 97. 69 Plut.

As the following analysis of Poseidonia-Paestum will show, Rome was the model for the colony’s political system. The rôle of the city was, however, adapted to fit its purposes as a colony as well as a product of new and previous influence and it was thus not a direct replica.72       After the founding of the Latin colony the city was altered radically (Table). The Greek/Lucanian agora ceased to be in use and instead a Roman forum was laid out in the southern part of the old agora. Traditional Roman buildings, especially those relating to political and juridical aspects, were constructed at the new forum and simultaneously the buildings with similar functions at the agora were demolished. The sanctuaries, however, remained in use, both the intramural and the extramural. They were respected by the new settlers and continued to be objects of worship.73 A striking continuity of divine worshipping is analysed in detail in the further analysis of the Sanctuary of Santa Venera.      The bonds with the mother colony, the city of Rome, were strong; both in a juridical and political sense as well as affectional. Paestum supported Rome in times of need and aligned itself with its mother colony politically and diplomatically. When the Carthaginian general Hannibal was roaming around southern Italy during the second Punic War, 218-201 BC, and literally breathing down the necks of the Paestans, the city still remained loyal to Rome. However, the many wars and the feeling of unsafety these times must have given rise to might have been a hard blow on the Paestan society. That said, it is a well-known fact that nothing binds a society together like a common enemy, and Paestum was thus rewarded for its loyalty. A certain degree of autonomy was given to the city and also the privilege of striking its own coins.74 Thus, Rome continued to be a strong influencer on the Paestan society although it is evident, which is shown in the further analysis of some aspects of the nature of Roman influence, that the city never forgot its Greek and Lucanian roots. In 133 the via Popilia, running to the east of Paestum, was constructed and as a result of this the city was unfortunately cut off from principal routes connecting the city to the rest of the peninsula.75                                                            71 Bispham 2006, 73-74. 72 Sewell 2010, 86. 73 Pedley 1990, 113. 74 Pedley 1990, 113. 75 Pedley 1990, 113-114.'}, {'current_refined_summary': \"**Final Summary:**\\n\\nPaestum, an ancient Greek city located on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea in Magna Graecia, was established around 600 BCE by settlers from Sybaris, originally named Poseidonia.

The city thrived as a Greek settlement for about two centuries, witnessing the development of democracy. In 400 BCE, the Lucanians seized the city. Romans took over in 273 BCE, renaming it Paestum and establishing a Latin colony. Later, its decline ensued from shifts in trade routes and the onset of flooding and marsh formation. As Pesto or Paestum, the town became a bishopric (now only titular), but it was abandoned in the Early Middle Ages, and left undisturbed and largely forgotten until the eighteenth century.\\nToday the remains of the city are found in the modern frazione of Paestum, which is part of the comune of Capaccio Paestum in the Province of Salerno in the region of Campania, Italy.

The city flourished for approximately two centuries, developing a democratic system and becoming a significant coastal town by 540 BCE. In 400 BCE, it came under the control of the Lucanians, an indigenous Italic people, who renamed it Paestum. Despite a brief liberation by Alexander, king of Epirus, around 332 BCE, the city remained under Lucanian rule until 273 BCE, when it became a Roman colony, continuing to thrive during the early Roman Empire. However, it eventually fell victim to environmental changes, such as the silting up of the Silarus River creating a malarial swamp, and was finally abandoned after being sacked by Muslim raiders in 871 CE.\\n\\nToday, the well-preserved ruins of Paestum, renowned for three large Doric temples constructed between 550 and 450 BCE, attract visitors to its archaeological site. The temples, dedicated to Hera and Athena, display traditional Greek architectural features, including massive colonnades with pronounced entasis.

The city enjoyed the status of an autonomous Greek polis and was endowed with a defensive wall with four gates, probably built in phases. Inside the city walls three Doric-style temples were erected in the sixth and fifth centuries. There has been some disagreement on which gods the temples were dedicated too, however, even though within the scope of this study they are referred to as Hera I, Hera II and the Temple of Athena, they might as well have been dedicated to more than one god. A Greek agora was also laid out north of the sanctuary of Hera (Fig. 6). It was adorned with a variety of Greek features; among them a bouleuterion or possible ekklesiasterion.55 An intriguing structure identified as a heroon, a place that has been interpreted as being dedicated to founder of the city, was built on the western edge of the agora around 510-500 BC.56 Outside the walls of the city a possible harbour, its existence and position is however debated, several nekropoleis and extramural cult sites were located; of which one will be the focus of this study: The Sanctuary of Santa Venera south of the city wall. Poseidonia came to enjoy intense cultural and commercial exchange with the rest of the Greek world as well as non-Greek populations like the Etruscans to the north and other Italic tribes from the hinterland. The Etruscan influence combined with the Greek and local Poseidonian style can for example be seen in the very famous fifth century tomb known as Tomba del Tuffatore, the Tomb of the Diver.57 Altogether Poseidonia prospered  and continued doing so. When its mother colony, Sybaris, fell in 510 BC Poseidonia along with other colonies filled the gap as a commercial and cultural centre.58 However, as the fifth century closed, changes loomed on the horizon and the Greek settlement at Poseidonia was to be forever marked by what was to come.   2.1.2.

Samnite people were expanding in numbers and in need of new homes, and therefore looked to the prosperous Greek and Etruscan coastal cities. At the end of the fifth century cities like Cumae and Capua had been captured by the Samnites and around 400 BC also Poseidonia came to be under control of the Lucanians.60 This is the traditional interpretation among scholars. However, in the final discussion of this study I hope to nuance this interpretation a bit.  Consequently, there has been a strong belief among many scholars that a “profound cultural change took place in the second half of the fifth century” at Poseidonia as a result of this Lucanian invasion.61 However, recent research has showed us otherwise. It is clear that Poseidonia at some point became a Lucanian city and that this happened gradually and peacefully. Much of the earlier historical interpretation of the Lucanian overtaking of Poseidonia derives from a statement made by Aristoxenos of Tarentum, a pupil of Aristoteles writing in the fourth century BC. He claims that the Greeks were essentially enslaved by the “Tyrrhenians”. This have led scholars to blame the Lucanians for this supposed regression in culture, politics and economy. The “Tyrrhenians” in this case have been interpreted as the Lucanians but it might as well refer to the Romans, Campanians, another Samnite people or the Etruscans; the latter have in fact in ancient literature been generally referred to as “Tyrrhenians”.62 The pessimistic literary evidence concerning the new trends in Poseidonia does, however, not have much support in the archaeological material. The supposed subjugation of the Greeks and the violent conquest of the city may in fact rather be a reflection of Greek attitudes in Tarentum or maybe even part of a larger process going on in Southern Italy at the time: Lucanization.63 But the evidence from Poseidonia suggests that the Greek practises continued; the bouleuterion and the heroon remained in use and so did the Greek sanctuaries and the Greek language.64 Some scholars claim that the change of the Greek name Poseidonia to Paistos or Paistom (later Paestum) can be seen as evidence of a conflict between Greeks and Lucanians, if this renaming happened under the Lucanian rule. The exact time of the change is however unsure, it might as well be a result of the later Roman conquest.65 Pedley does, on the contrary, not agree with the renaming \\n                                                59 Fracchia & Gualtieri 1989, 217. 60 Pedley 1990, 97. 61 Pedley 1990, 97; Horsnaes 2002, 11. 62 Isayev 2007, 17-18. 63 Isayev 2007, 18-19; Zuchtriegel 2016, 14.  64 Pedley 1990, 97. 65 Mello 1985, 15.'}, {'current_refined_summary': '**Final Summary:**\\n\\nPaestum, an ancient Greek city located on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea in Magna Graecia, was established around 600 BCE by settlers from Sybaris, originally named Poseidonia.

During the fourth century BC and up to the establishing of the Latin colony in 273 BC Poseidonia prospered as revealed in the archaeological record. Although there were no major large-scale building programmes to match the constructions of the Greek temples and sanctuaries those places continued to be looked after and the gods were worshiped by the new inhabitants.67 However, two stoai were built at the Greek agora as well as an Asklepieion (Table). The changes that came along with the Lucanians are to be seen in the agriculturalization and the density of settlement of the territory of Poseidonia as well as new burial practices in terms of extraordinary decorations.68   2.1.3. The Latin colony In 273 BC the expanding city of Rome had reached past the river Sele and stood at the gates of the Greek/Lucanian city of Poseidonia. Rome had been expanding for years, and the Republic was founding colonies, ex novo or, in the case of Poseidonia-Paestum, taking over already established settlements, all over the Italian peninsula. The Roman colonies, perhaps especially the ones that were founded during the late Republic, were behaving in a strikingly uniform way. The Roman, or the Latin, colony, is well known for its formulaic way of structure and features; in other words, we know the nature of a Roman colony without having to see one. The foundation ritual has been described in ancient literary sources and is said to originate from the time of Rome’s mythological foundation when Romulus, 753 BC, with permission of the gods laid out the sacred boundary, pomerium, around the city.69 The founding ritual of the colonies is describes by Bispham in the article ‘Coloniam deducere: how Roman was the Roman colonisation during the middle Republic?’:   Firstly, the deductio, or marching out, of the colonists from Rome to the site of the colony; the deductor (founder), in ritual dress (the cinctus Gabinus), ploughs the sulcus primigenius (the original furrow), tracing the line of the future walls and instantiating a ritual barrier, the pomoerium.70    In other words, it is clear that there was a model for Roman colonization and that the newly founded colonies were using the same set of rules and rituals to express their relationship, as                                                 66 Pedley 1990, 97.  67 Pedley 1990, 112. 68 Pedley 1990, 97. 69 Plut.

As the following analysis of Poseidonia-Paestum will show, Rome was the model for the colony’s political system. The rôle of the city was, however, adapted to fit its purposes as a colony as well as a product of new and previous influence and it was thus not a direct replica.72       After the founding of the Latin colony the city was altered radically (Table). The Greek/Lucanian agora ceased to be in use and instead a Roman forum was laid out in the southern part of the old agora. Traditional Roman buildings, especially those relating to political and juridical aspects, were constructed at the new forum and simultaneously the buildings with similar functions at the agora were demolished. The sanctuaries, however, remained in use, both the intramural and the extramural. They were respected by the new settlers and continued to be objects of worship.73 A striking continuity of divine worshipping is analysed in detail in the further analysis of the Sanctuary of Santa Venera.      The bonds with the mother colony, the city of Rome, were strong; both in a juridical and political sense as well as affectional. Paestum supported Rome in times of need and aligned itself with its mother colony politically and diplomatically. When the Carthaginian general Hannibal was roaming around southern Italy during the second Punic War, 218-201 BC, and literally breathing down the necks of the Paestans, the city still remained loyal to Rome. However, the many wars and the feeling of unsafety these times must have given rise to might have been a hard blow on the Paestan society. That said, it is a well-known fact that nothing binds a society together like a common enemy, and Paestum was thus rewarded for its loyalty. A certain degree of autonomy was given to the city and also the privilege of striking its own coins.74 Thus, Rome continued to be a strong influencer on the Paestan society although it is evident, which is shown in the further analysis of some aspects of the nature of Roman influence, that the city never forgot its Greek and Lucanian roots. In 133 the via Popilia, running to the east of Paestum, was constructed and as a result of this the city was unfortunately cut off from principal routes connecting the city to the rest of the peninsula.75                                                            71 Bispham 2006, 73-74. 72 Sewell 2010, 86. 73 Pedley 1990, 113. 74 Pedley 1990, 113. 75 Pedley 1990, 113-114.'}, {'current_refined_summary': \"**Final Summary:**\\n\\nPaestum, an ancient Greek city located on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea in Magna Graecia, was established around 600 BCE by settlers from Sybaris, originally named Poseidonia.
